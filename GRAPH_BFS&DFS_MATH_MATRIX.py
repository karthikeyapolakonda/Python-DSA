#200. Number of Islands
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid
are all surrounded by water.
Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

# 695. Max Area of Island
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
               [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
               [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
